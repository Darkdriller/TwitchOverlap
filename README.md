# Visualizing Twitch Communities
## Overview
This project aims to map popular channels on Twitch.tv in a way that feels intuitive to both viewers and streamers. This is accomplished by collecting who is watching different streamers at regular intervals, comparing these lists, and turning that information into a network diagram. All code is written in python and the visualization is done using Gephi.
